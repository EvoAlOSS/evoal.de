  - title: "Applied Researcher"
    excerpt: "*EvoAl* uses domain-specific languages for specifying all aspects of
      optimisation. Starting with data definition, problem specification, algorithm
      configuration, and ending at surrogate learning. *EvoAl* reduces the programming
      effort to zero by using these domain-specific languages. *EvoAl* supports you
      in the configuration by validating the requirements of algorithms against your
      data. This is important to make sure that the algorithm can produce the best
      results possible."

  - title: "Optimisation Researcher"
    excerpt: "*EvoAl* supports different optimisation algorithms, community benchmarks,
    and surrogate function learning. *EvoAl* takes care of training surrogate functions,
    either on real-world data or benchmarks, encoding your data for the optimisation
    algorithm, and determining useful metrics for statistical evaluation."

  - title: "EvoAl Contributor"
    excerpt: "*EvoAl* has a component architecture with well-defined interfaces. It
    uses dependency injection to wire all components at runtime based on the DSL-based
    configuration. As extensibility and maintainability are in focus during development,
    you can easily add own components to *EvoAl* and extend the domain-specific language.
    *EvoAl* users can simply use your extension by copying your *plugin* into a *EvoAl*
    release."

# Welcome to the home of *EvoAl*.

*EvoAl* is a tool suite that focuses on making optimisation easier to use while
it checks the correctness of configurations. Thus, we aim to make optimisation
algorithms and research accessible to applied researchers and domain experts.
As *EvoAl* and this site are still under construction, there is room for
improvement. At the moment, you find more information on our
[GitLab project]((https://gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de/evoal/source/evoal-core))
and its Wiki, which is hosted at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de).
EvoAl is an open-source research software that is used in several academic
publications, which you find on the [publications page](pages/publications).

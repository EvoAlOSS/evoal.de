# Welcome to the home of *EvoAl*.

*EvoAl* is a tool suite that focuses on optimisation. We aim at making optimisation research accessible
to applied researchers without plenty of programming skills. As this site is still under construction it
is still incomplete. Nevertheless, you can already some more information at our [GitLab page](https://gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de/evoal/source/evoal-core)
which is hosted at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de). *EvoAl* is a research software
that we used in several academic publications which you can find on the [publications](publications) page

  - title: "Applied Researcher"
    excerpt: "*EvoAl* uses domain-specific languages for specifying all aspects of
    optimisation. Starting with data definition, algorithm specification, and ending
    at surrogate learning. *EvoAl* reduces the programming effort to zero by using
    these domain-specific languages."

  - title: "Optimisation Researcher"
    excerpt: "*EvoAl* supports different optimisation algorithms, community benchmarks,
    and surrogate function learning. *EvoAl* takes care of training surrogate functions,
    either on real-world data or benchmarks, encoding your data for the optimisation
    algorithm, and determining useful metrics for statistical evaluation."

  - title: "EvoAl Contributor"
    excerpt: "*EvoAl* has a component architecture with well-defined interfaces. It
    uses dependency injection to wire all components at runtime based on the DSL-based
    configuration. As extensibility and maintainability are in focus during development,
    you can easily add own components to *EvoAl* and extend the domain-specific language.
    *EvoAl* users can simply use your extension by copying your *plugin* into a *EvoAl*
    release."

# Welcome to the home of *EvoAl*.

*EvoAl* is a tool suite that focuses on optimisation. We aim at making optimisation research accessible
to applied researchers without plenty of programming skills. As this site is still under construction it
is still incomplete. Nevertheless, you can already some more information at our [GitLab page](https://gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de/evoal/source/evoal-core)
which is hosted at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de). *EvoAl* is a research software
that we used in several academic publications which you can find on the [publications](pages/publications) page
